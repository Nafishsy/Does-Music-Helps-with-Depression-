**Project Title: Music and Mental Health: KNN Classification of Music Effects**

***Description***

This project investigates the relationship between music and mental health using the 'mxmh_survey_results.csv' dataset. It employs K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) to classify the perceived effects of music (improve, worsen, no effect) on individuals experiencing anxiety, depression, insomnia, and OCD.")

***Installation***

List the required R packages and provide installation instructions:\
**Required Packages:**

* dplyr
* caret
* class

**Setup:**

If you don't have these packages installed, you can install them using the following command in your R console:

```R
install.packages(c("dplyr", "caret", "class"))
```


***Data Preparation:***

The code assumes a CSV file named "mxmh_survey_results.csv" is present in your working directory.
If the file is located elsewhere, modify the read.csv function call accordingly.
Consider adding a section on how to acquire the dataset if it's publicly available.
Running the Script:

Execute the R script in your R console line by line.
This will perform the data cleaning, feature engineering, KNN classification, and display the results.
Output

The script outputs the following:
* Summary of the preprocessed data using str(data.subset)
* First few rows of the preprocessed data using head(data.subset)
* Classification accuracy using KNN (ACC.20)
* Confusion matrix (ConfusionMAT)
* Assumptions and Limitations

The code assumes the "mxmh_survey_results.csv" dataset has the expected format.
Data cleaning and feature engineering might need adjustments depending on the specific dataset.
KNN is a simple algorithm. Consider exploring other machine learning models for potentially better performance.
Future Work

Explore other machine learning algorithms for classification (e.g., decision trees, random forests).
Incorporate additional features or transformations for improved model performance.
Visualize the results using appropriate plots (e.g., scatter plots, boxplots).
License

Include a license (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0) to specify how others can use and modify your code. You can find license templates online.
Contribution

If you welcome contributions to the project, provide guidelines on how to submit pull requests.
Additional Notes

Consider adding comments within the code to explain specific steps or logic.
You can use R Markdown to create a more interactive and visually appealing README file that combines code, text, and output.
